ðŸŒŒ 3D Menger Sponge Visualization with Pygame and OpenGL ðŸŒŒ

Developing this project was a captivating journey into the realm of 3D graphics programming.

I faced challenges in ensuring all sides of the cubes were visible and implemented various color palettes to enhance visual interest. Overall, it was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of computer graphics.

Project Overview

This project implements a mesmerizing 3D visualization of the Menger Sponge fractal using
Python, Pygame, and OpenGL. 
The code generates a rotating Menger Sponge composed of cubes, each with its own vibrant color palette&Key Features

    Utilizes Pygame and OpenGL for efficient 3D rendering.
    Dynamically generates a Menger Sponge fractal with customizable subdivision levels.
    Offers a variety of color palettes, including complementary, analogous, and triadic schemes.

Experience

Developing this project was a captivating journey into the realm of 3D graphics programming. I faced challenges in ensuring all sides of the cubes were visible and implemented various color palettes to enhance visual interest. Overall, it was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of computer graphics.
